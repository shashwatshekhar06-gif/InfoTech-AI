## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashwatshekhar06-gif/InfoTech-AI.git
cd InfoTech-AI
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API keys

Create an `api.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored):

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serpapi-key-here
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your-key-id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit `api.env` to git.** It is listed in `.gitignore` for this reason.

### 5. Run database migration (first time only)

```bash
python migrate_db.py
```

### 6. Launch the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 How the Research Engine Works

1. **Query Classification** — Detects whether the query is about a company or a general topic using keyword matching and regex patterns
2. **Company Name Extraction** — Identifies the target company from known lists and NLP patterns
3. **Targeted Web Searches** — Runs 5 parallel SerpAPI queries covering: contact info, careers, company overview, LinkedIn, and salary/culture
4. **LLM Extraction** — GPT-3.5-turbo (JSON mode, temperature=0.1) extracts structured data from search results
5. **Post-Processing** — Fills any remaining unknown fields using pattern-based URL construction and known company data
6. **Fallback Handling** — If JSON parsing fails, a smart fallback extracts key data from raw search results

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are loaded from `api.env` using `python-dotenv` — never hardcoded
- `api.env` is listed in `.gitignore` — should never be committed
- Razorpay payments use HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- All user passwords should be hashed in production (see `db_utils.py`)
